# RentReadyTestTask

Good day! I completed the test task, as much as time allows me (approximately 8 hours of work),
because I lost my job due to the war in Ukraine and I need to pay a mortgage, in a month already
nothing, I'm in a hurry.
Of course, you probably expected more, but I do not have more time to devote to the task,
I ask you to evaluate at least this, because Azure functions and Dataverse were new to me,
but at least I wrote a function for Azure and deployed to myself:

As far as I could provide the logic for duplicating information,
and I hope that I understood the task correctly, because it was in English. and blurry enough for me.
If I have not lived up to expectations, I offer to work in a half-pay format while I
I will not start accurately and sufficiently to benefit the company.
